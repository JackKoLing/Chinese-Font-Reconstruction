> Calligraphy is a piece of gem in Chinese splendid ancient culture, endowed with various font families and multiple factions within each font family in the evolution of thousand of years. However, most ancient calligraphy works are carved onto stones. After years of weathering, many of the characters are incomplete, which is a huge loss not only to China, but also to the cultural heritage of the world. As Chinese calligraphy learners and lovers ever since the childhood, we feel responsible and passionate to restore and protect them. By using Machine Learning, we are hoping to reconstruct those incomplete calligraphy characters of different font families, by learning from those complete calligraphy characters in existence, and from the context of the characters in the document.
